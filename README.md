## PROBLEM STATEMENT

One – third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally. This amounts to about 1.3 Billion tons per year. All the food produced but never eaten would be sufficient to feed 2 Billion people. That’s more than twice the number of undernourished people across the globe. Currently there are many NGO’s providing food to the vulnerable.

Every day a lot of food gets wasted in occasions like weddings, festivals etc. What if there was a direct way to connect the people who have access food to the NGO’s who are already working for this cause.
**FoodPro** is a web-app that we built which connects these NGO’s to the food providers and helps them to access and provide food easily to the vulnerable

Among The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, we chose “No Hunger”. Being from India, Our country's contribution to wasted food, at 68.8 million tonnes annually, is 7% of the global total, as per the United Nations Environment Programme's Food Waste Index Report 2021.We have personally witnessed the poor sleeping with empty stomachs while so much food is wasted in weddings, occasions etc. So, our goal is to set a balance and provide that excess food to the people in need.
The food provider can be anyone irrespective of the food quantity they have. Similary, individual people can also register as an NGO who wish to volunteer and take food to the needy.

## Challenges we ran into
It was a challenging task to display user's location on the community page 

## What's next for **Foodpro**
The next step is to further improve the model's functionalities and enhance the UI/UX of the web app.
