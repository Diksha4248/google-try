 login logout session
 


Sure, I can help you with that!

First, you will need to set up a Firebase account and create a new project. Then, you will need to create two collections in your Firestore database: "food_providers" and "ngos". Each collection will store the user data for the respective user type.

In your Flask application, you will need to create routes for user registration and login. You can use Firebase Authentication to handle user authentication. Once a user is authenticated, you can use their UID to create a new document in the appropriate collection.

For the food provider functionality, you will need to create a new collection in Firestore called "food_posts". Each document in this collection will represent a single food post and will contain information such as the quantity of food available and the location of the provider. When a food provider creates a new post, you can add a new document to this collection with the relevant information.

To display the available posts to NGOs, you can create a route that retrieves all documents in the "food_posts" collection and displays them in a list. NGOs can then select a post and claim it by updating the "claimed_by" field of the document to the UID of the NGO that claimed it.

To allow NGOs to filter posts by distance and quantity, you can use the GeoFirestore library to perform geospatial queries on the location data in the "food_posts" collection. You can also use Firestore queries to filter posts by quantity.

I hope that helps you get started with your project! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
